## Development

The client code for operational insights (OMS) is autogenerated from the
swagger definition (https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) 
using autorest (https://github.com/Azure/autorest). Use the most recent
version of autorest. Generally that means installing wuth nuget.

### Getting with nuget on Mac

Nuget can be run using mono on Mac OS X and it all can be retrieved with
Homebrew (http://brew.sh/)

```
brew install mono nuget
nuget install autorest
```

The autorest executable is then found in `AutoRest.0.17.3/tools/`

### Using Autorest to generate sources.

```
mono AutoRest.exe \
    --Namespace se.kth.integral.oms \
    -Input .../azure-rest-api-specs/arm-operationalinsights/2015-03-20/swagger/OperationalInsights.json \
    -CodeGenerator Azure.Java \
    -Modeler Swagger
```

The code is then found in the `Generated` folder. Move it to the destination.
